Semi-Supervised k-Star (SSS) with Holo-Training

Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning technique focused on using both labeled data and unlabeled data to perform a particular learning task. 

K-Star is a one of the lazy learning algorihms.

SSS is the semi-supervised version of the k-Star algorithm, which is based on holo-training principle.
